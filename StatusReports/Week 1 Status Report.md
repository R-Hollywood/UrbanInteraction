# Week 1 Status Report

Over summer I watched the documentary "The social life of small urban spaces" that you recommended.
In the week since our meeting I have thought about what hardware could be effectively utilised and what hardware I would like to use.
I decided that VR could be an interesting choice.
I ordered a copy of "Life Between Buildings" by Jan Gehl and plan to read it in week 2.
