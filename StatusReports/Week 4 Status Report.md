# Week 4 Status Report

Created a list of interesting scenarios/places the project could be used in. 
Read papers on public displays, remote awareness and giving displays the affordance of being interactive.
Got further into the Jan Gehl book and began researching how to code a simple stream between a mobile phone camera and a scene in Unity.
