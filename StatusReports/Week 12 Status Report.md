This week was mainly research based.
I watched videos and read tutorials on how to apply textures in Blender, how/if bending terrain was possible so I could limit the floating effect the ferns currently have and searched to see if others had had similar problems with camera flipping in the Gear VR.
I met my supervisor briefly the day before our scheduled meeting to discuss other possible causes of the camera flipping, during this time I received a Samusung S7 phone to test that the problem was not due to a fault with my own phone that I ahd been using for development.
Disocvered that the camera flipping was due to the user accidentally touching the touchpad on the side of the headset during use so I began to research methods of disableing te touchpad.
The rest of the week was spent UV mapping the 3d model of the decking, applying the texture and then importing it into Unity.
When imported the 3d model lost its texture, so I sought information from a friend experienced in blender as to how I might import the textured model into Unity.
Added a windzone to the project which makes the ferns sway slightly in the breeze.
