# Week 9 Status Report

Not much to report.

Decided that running a within subjects study where subjects take a survey at the end to gather qualitative data would probably be the best idea.
Looked into tracking a subjects eyes to create a heatmap of where they looked most but Samsung Gear does not appear to have these capabilities.
