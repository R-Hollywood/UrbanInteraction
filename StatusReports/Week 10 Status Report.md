Started adding 3D elements to the 360 video player. Added a raindrop effect in front of where the waterfall appears and added ferns at the feet of where the camera spawns.
I began experimenting with adding a water droplet effect to the camera as if the spray from the waterfall was hitting glasses or goggles.
I figured that although many users may not wear glasses that this would not break their immersion as the weight of the headset on their face would always mean the user was aware of something being infront of their eyes.
I then changed how I was adding the ferns, rather than having them added as individual models I created a terrain element and had it randomly populate itself with ferns.
I then edited this terrain so that it appeared transparent such that the video playing was visible between the modelled ferns.
Started to create the 3d model for the decking.
