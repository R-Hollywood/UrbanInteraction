# Week 2 Status Report

In the week since our meeting I have set up a github repository (https://github.com/R-Hollywood/UrbanInteraction) and installed Mendeley to manage my references.
I also installed pdflatex to work on my dissertation and generated a basic outline. Started a Project Log to keep track of time spent on the project and retrospectively made meeting minutes.

Read some articles and watched some videos to research the feasability of streaming a 360 video to a VR headset live.
