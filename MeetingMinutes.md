# Meeting Minutes

## Week 1
Spoke about narrowing the scope of the project as the project outline was open ended. Task for the week was to think about what hardware I wanted to use.

## Week 2
Decided to work with VR. Discussed idea of using VR and 360 camera to create a virtual peephole to another space. Task for the week was to set up my workspace (Github, Mendeley etc) and research the feasability of the project.

## Week 3
No meeting. Email Contact only.

## Week 4
Discussed feasability of project. Set 3 tasks to be completed by next meeting. 
	-Create List of interesting places the Project could be situated
	-Do more background reading on remote awareness and public displays
	-Try and set up a livestream into a scene in Unity
## Week 5
Received a Samsung Gear and 360 Camera.
	-Try and set up a livestream from camera to VR

## Week 6
No meeting. Email contact only.

## Week 7
Discussed that camera did not support livestreaming. Changed scope to be to play a pre-recorded video on VR to act as a proof of concept for the streaming concept. Set task to create a 360 video player in Unity and have it working on Samsung Gear for next meeting, also discussed direction we could take the project as a study and how we could work to improve emmersion. Returned 360 camera.

## Week 8
Discussed progress. Generic video without 3d elements almost complete sound needs added and delay in looping needs fixed. Think about how the study will be performed. Between or within subjects? What type of data will be collected quantatitive or qualatitive? Dissertation topic finalised: How does the inclusion of 3d modelled objects in a 360 video affect immersion in Virtual Reality?

## Week 9

Short meeting. Recap of the week before, emphasis on importance of pushing through with the completion of the technical aspects before December.

## Week 10

Short meeting. Recap of the week before, emphasis on importance of pushing through with the completion of the technical aspects before December. Organised a Demo for the next week.

## Week 11

Demo. Discussed problem where the camera would randomly flip on the z-axis or move without the user moving their head. Suggested logging accelerometer values and testing the application on a different phone.

## Week 12

Discussed the accelerometer error. Discovered it was not a software or hardware error but was in fact due to users accidentally brushing against the touchpad on the side of the headset. Discussed applying for ethics approval due to the use of non standard hardware. Returned S7 Phone. Also discussed goals to be achieved over Christmas period:

	Start the Introduction and Background sections of the Dissertation.
	Write up a draft of the User Evaluation Questionnaire.
	Add gaze tracking to the application.
