# Meeting Minutes

## Week 1
Spoke about narrowing the scope of the project as the project outline was open ended. Task for the week was to think about what hardware I wanted to use.

## Week 2
Decided to work with VR. Discussed idea of using VR and 360 camera to create a virtual peephole to another space. Task for the week was to set up my workspace (Github, Mendeley etc) and research the feasability of the project.

##Week 3
No meeting. Email Contact only.
