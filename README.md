## Urban Interaction
This repository contains all documentation and code pertaining to my 4th year individual project at the University of Glasgow. This project was supervised by Dr Julie Williamson.

The aim of the project is to create a fun interactive installment in a public space and document how/if it changes how people use the space.

  ## Project Heimdall
  
  The project involves setting up a 360 camera in a preordained area and then setting up a Virtual Reality headset in an area of high juxtaposition to the area of the camera. A livestream between the camera and the headset is then established so that when a person looks into the headset it is as if they are transported to the area thw camera is in.
